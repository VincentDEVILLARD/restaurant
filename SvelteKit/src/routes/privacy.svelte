                    The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We
                    treat your personal data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data
                    protection regulations and this privacy policy.<br />
                    If you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be collected. Personal information
                    is any data with which you could be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what
                    information we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this
                    happens.<br />
                    Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject
                    to security breaches. Complete protection of your data from third-party access is not possible.

                    a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard,
                    machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible
                    party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.

                <p>
                    Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any
                    viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies
                    are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.<br />
                    Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after
                    your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies
                    make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.<br />
                    You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide
                    on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can
                    be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them,
                    or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the
                    functionality of this website.<br />
                    Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions
                    you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter
                    f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure
                    an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used
                    to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy
                    policy.

                <h3><strong>Server log files</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser
                    automatically transmits to us in "server log files". These are:

                <ul>
                    <li>- Browser type and browser version</li>

                <p>
                    These data will not be combined with data from other sources.<br />
                    The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to
                    fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.

                <p>
                    This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc.,
                    1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.<br />
                    Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your computer
                    and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the
                    cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and
                    stored there.<br />
                    Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a
                    legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.<br

                <h3><strong>IP anonymization</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be
                    shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the
                    European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases
                    is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will
                    use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the
                    website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services regarding
                    website activity and Internet usage for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by
                    your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by
                    Google.

                    and that you agree to receive this newsletter. No additional data is collected or is only
                    collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested information and
                    do not pass it on to third parties.<br />
                    We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per
                    Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as

                    in the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.<br
                    />
                    The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter
                    until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other
                    purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remain unaffected.

                    Our website uses plugins from YouTube, which is operated by Google. The operator of the

                    />
                    If you're logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing behavior
                    directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.<br
                    />
                    YouTube is used to help make our website appealing. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant
                    to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.<br />
                    Further information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration
